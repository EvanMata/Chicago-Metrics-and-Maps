Crime Score Disclaimer

The crime score metric is better in aggregate, as that serves to smooth our some of its inconsistancies. 
The methodology behind the crime score calculation is as follows: 
Every crime within the database has an Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR) code. Each of these can be 
mapped to a section of Illinois State Law, which has a associated Felony level and recommended sentence
length. However, Illinois state law is highly irregular in format, so this data cannot be easily scraped.
IUCRs are also grouped into categories - such as Robbery. For each categories, one can find a rough average 
felony level. The 5 felony levels in Illinois have basic statistics that can be used to as metrics for
weighing. However, this has a number of issues:
One category, say Assult, has some very low and very high felony levels. Averaging them out gives a skewed
distribution. 
Even for a single IUCR within a category there are a range of circumstances that can extend or reduce the
sentence. A special case is homicide - it is a lv X Felony, which caps at 30 years sentence, but it carries
the death penalty or at the very least an extended sentence (twice the length of a normal Felony X).
